# Global Intelligence Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to Dmitrii Ponomarev's DAT5902 - Professional Software and Career Practices 
module repo. 

This project explores the relationships between average IQ scores, socio-economic factors, and educational indicators across continents. The dataset includes variables such as IQ, Continent, HDI, School Years, GNI, and Population. The goal is to derive meaningful insights into the global distribution of intelligence and its correlation with various socio-economic parameters.

## Files and Structure

- `HTML Data`: Contais [Countris and their average IQ](https://www.datapandas.org/ranking/average-iq-by-country)


### 2. Analysis

- `Main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis process.


### 3. Functions
- `Functions folder`: Contains all self-made functions to be tested

### 4. Testing
